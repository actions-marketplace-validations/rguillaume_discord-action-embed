## Testing / Contributing.

We suggest everyone uses a tool like https://github.com/nektos/act to test GitHub actions locally. This is the tool I use so the directory structure will reflect that. If the following command does not pass, I will not accept your PR.

install act see https://github.com/nektos/act for instructions.
make sure the following command passes.

```act pull_request -W tests/workflows -e tests/mock-payload.json```
